Due to size restrictions, we could not upload the original unprocessed dataset.
We called this twitterTweetsPosNegRandomized.csv . You can download the dataset
from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140 , however the csv
file will have a different name and more records. When we downloaded it, the 
first thing we did was to rename it and remove some rows of data. If you would
like this twitterTweetsPosNegRandomized.csv dataset, kindly contact us.
